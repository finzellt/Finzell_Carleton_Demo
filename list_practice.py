#calculating interest rate

'''
1. Define a list called letters with the following values: “A”, “B”, and “C” (in that order)
2. Write a line of code with a print statement that uses the letters list to print out the word “CAB” (I.e., “C”, “A”, and “B”).
3. Modify your code from above to append the values “D” and “E” to your list. Change the print statement so that it prints out word “DECADE”.
